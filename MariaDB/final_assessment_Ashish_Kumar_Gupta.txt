Create a deleted_customer table to insert deleted records.

>> create table deleted_customer(cust_name varchar(35),email varchar(50),phone char(10),address1 varchar(20),address varchar(20),city varchar(20),pincode int,cust_request text,reported_date date);

Now create a trigger which executes before every delete command on customer_details table

>>Delimiter //
>create trigger del before delete on customer_details for each row
>begin
>	insert into deleted_customer(cust_name,email,phone,address1,address2,city,pincode,cust_request,reported_date) values(old.cust_name,old.email,old.phone,old.address1,old.address2,old.city,old.pincode,old.cust_request,old.reported_date);
>end;
>>//

Now whenever a row deleted from customer_details it get first inserted in deleted_customer tables automatically.
