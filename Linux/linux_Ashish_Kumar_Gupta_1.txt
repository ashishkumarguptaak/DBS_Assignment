A shared mount allows the creation of an exact replica of a given mount point.
When a mount point is marked as a shared mount, any mount within the original mount point is reflected in it and vice versa.
To change the type of a mount point to a shared mount, type the following at a shell prompt:
mount --make-shared mount_point


In order to prevent a given mount point from being duplicated whatever, an unbindable mount is used.
To change the type of a mount point to an unbindable mount, type the following at a shell prompt:
mount --make-unbindable mount_point
